“This report highlights jobs that stand out across three key factors: earning potential, hiring demand and job 
satisfaction,” says Glassdoor Chief Economist, Andrew Chamberlain, as part of the company’s release of the report.  
“In particular for job satisfaction, our research shows that higher pay is statistically linked to higher satisfaction, 
but the impact is actually small. Money can buy happiness, but other workplace factors actually have a larger impact on 
your overall satisfaction — including culture and values, career opportunities and the quality of senior leadership.”
“报告中突出的职位，有三个关键因素：收入潜力、求职需求和工作满意度”，Glassdoor的首席经济学家Andrew Chamberlain在公司的报告中提到。“就工作
满意度来说，我们的调查表明薪水越高满意度越高，但影响不大。金钱可以买到高兴，但工作氛围确实更能让你开心——包括文化和价值观，职业机会和高层领导
的能力。“

The top job, according to Glassdoor’s report, is data scientist. Data powers various aspects of business strategy, 
technology development, science, transportation and even sports. When coupled with tech skills like programming languages, 
a job candidate will find that many doors open on the job market. According to the report, data scientists earn a median 
annual salary of $110,000, and has a high score for job satisfaction.
根据Glassdoor的报告，数据科学家是个高端职位。数据驱动着商业的多方面，技术开发、科学、运输甚至是体育。像编程语言的这样技术技能，在人才市场
上有很多空缺。根据这个报告，数据科学家能拿到的中等水平年薪为$110,00，而且幸福感指数比较高。

Says Chamberlain: “Data scientist has ruled as one of the hottest jobs for years, proven by its third consecutive No. 1 
ranking on Glassdoor’s 50 Best Jobs in America list. This is due to the high demand (4,524 open jobs), the high 
salary ($110,000 median base salary) and high job satisfaction (4.2). Not only are tech companies scrambling to hire 
data scientists, but industries across the board, from health care to nonprofits to retail, are also searching for this 
talent.”
Chamberlain提到：“根据Glassdoor给出的美国最好的50个工作排名中，数据科学家已经是第三次连续排名第一，证明这个职位确实已经热门了很多年。这得
益于高需求（4,524个开放的职位），高薪水（$110,000的中等基础薪水），以及较高的职业满意度（4.2）。不仅仅是技术公司在争着雇佣数据科学家，从健康
医疗到非盈利机构，再到零食业，整体都在寻找这样的人才。

Second on Glassdoor’s ranking is the role of DevOps engineer. In that role, a candidate must be able to build services 
within a company’s digital infrastructure, test them, oversee or work in teams and wear several hats (figuratively, not 
literally—though headwear is an option, I’m guessing). It’s worth noting that it is a difficult role to fill for many 
organizations, which empowers the job seeker.
Glassdoor上排名第二的是DevOps工程师。这样的角色，候选人需要能够基于公司的数字化基础设施，构建服务，进行测试，在团队中监督并且带多顶帽子（我
猜，这是个比喻，而不是字面意义上的帽子）。值得注意的是，对于很多组织来说，却很难填补这样的人员。

By the numbers, DevOps engineers make an annual median salary of $105,000, and according to Glassdoor’s reviews, score 
four out of five in the job satisfaction rating.
